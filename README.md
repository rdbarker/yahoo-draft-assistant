# Yahoo Draft Assistant

**This project has barely been started**

The goal of this project is to update a spreadsheet in real time while you are actively drafting players. The application will update a list of players in your desired Excel spreadsheet and in your desired sheet. You can then use this information to filter remianing players in the draft, etc.
